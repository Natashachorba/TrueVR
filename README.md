This project will aim to utilize some sort of heaset (most likely) to monitor the firing of neurons and 
replicate the associated movements in a virtual reality

As this project is very ambitious and will be limited by access to technological advances, I have split it into several parts:

1. Create a basic Virtual Reality, most likely in Unity,that can be used for prototyping all the movements and actions.
2. Implement multiplayer support to the world.
3. Add voice integration for speaking in between real people
4. Create complex AI using any available resources that can interact with the player moderately well
5. Create the neural link system
6.Create a physical robot that can stream video and environmental information (such as wind power)
    to the machine so as to have a 3rd sense integrated along with real world travel instead of just VR
    (this would allow for the possibility of paralyzed people being able to travel as they wish or something)
